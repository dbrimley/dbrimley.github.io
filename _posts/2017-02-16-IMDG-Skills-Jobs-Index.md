excerpt: I ran across a LinkedIn post yesterday from 451 Research, they were updating their NoSQL Skills index at the request of a poster.  It was a pretty simple thing, that was based on the counts of a few different LinkedIn Searches on skills mentioned in peoples bios.  It had the usual suspects like MongoDB, Redis & Couchbase.  However, there wasn't anything regarding IMDG (In Memory Data Grids).

### How relevant are my IMDG skills?

I ran across a LinkedIn post yesterday from 451 Research, they were updating their NoSQL Skills index at the request of a poster.  It was a pretty simple thing, that was based on the counts of a few different LinkedIn Searches on skills mentioned in peoples bios.  It had the usual suspects like MongoDB, Redis & Couchbase.  However, there wasn't anything regarding IMDG (In Memory Data Grids). 

As an independent IMDG consultant, I'm always keen to make sure that my skill set aligns with the current trends and demands of the market.  I'm not particularly keen on being out of work.  My skills are in Gemfire, Hazelcast and Oracle Coherence....if you're interested in hiring me. 

So purely for my own interest, I ran a few searches against LinkedIn.  There's nothing scientific about them and they're all easily reproduced for verification.  I've made no attempt to find duplicates in terms of job postings and I've tried my best to merge results where a product might be known under two different names.

I've chosen what I consider to be the top 5 IMDG, Four of them are open source and one is proprietary, closed source.

### IMDG Product mentioned in LinkedIn Bio.

An important statistic and a good indicator of a products popularity.  I could imagine this might be quite important to an organisation if they're looking at the talent pool available.

This shows that the Granddaddy of IMDG, Oracle Coherence wins closely followed by Hazelcast.  Not an unexpected result, Oracle Coherence has been the bulwark of many IMDG systems for quite a few years now.  I first came across it in 2006 when it was still Tangosol, yet to be bought out by Oracle.  Oracle Coherence was the first IMDG I ever used.

Notes : LinkedIn Search for UK jobs using product keywords. Where a product is known by 2 names results have been combined.  This could advantage these products as the same job may be double counted.
â€¨There could be duplicate entries from multiple agencies listing same job.

Search conducted on 16th February 2017

### IMDG Product Job Listings

This is the big one for me, is there enough work out there? Are organisations going to need my skills?  The strange thing here is that Oracle Coherence dips quite a bit after the good results in the skills count,  I'm not sure what this indicates.  It could mean that the Coherence people are happy in their jobs and not moving or maybe there's not much new development going on. I would imagine some analysis of Coherence Bios might reveal if people are still working in this area.

I'm happy to see that Hazelcast has a big requirement for jobs, also Gemfire one of my other skills seems to be in demand.

I'm based in the UK, that has quite a low set of numbers so I've also included USA jobs listed.

### Conclusion

For me, personally, I think I've selected the right IMDG products to keep my career ticking along. To verify what I'm seeing here isn't totally unreasonable I also took a look at the excellent ![db-engines ranking website](http://db-engines.com/en/ranking), they include many different types of Database, including IMDG which they list as Key Values stores, which does them a bit of a disservice in my opinion, they're so much more than that.  In any case their rankings seem to back up what I've seen in this brief search on LinkedIn.

Let me know what you think in the comments section below.  Does this all tally with your current experiences of the IMDG job market?
